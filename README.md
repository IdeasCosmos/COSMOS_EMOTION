## A Multi-Vector Emotion Dynamics Engine for Next-Generation AI Systems

COSMOS_EMOTION simulates emotional dynamics in multi-dimensional vector spaces, enabling state transitions that respond to temporal evolution and external stimuli. Unlike traditional sentiment classifiers, this system quantizes complex emotional states into evolving vector representations, modeling how feelings transform over time.

---

## Overview

COSMOS_EMOTION goes beyond binary sentiment analysis. It treats emotions as dynamic states in a high-dimensional space, where multiple concurrent feelings interact, intensify, and decay according to well-defined transition rules.

**Core Innovation:** Living artificial emotions through hierarchical gradient propagation and cascade-controlled state evolution.
